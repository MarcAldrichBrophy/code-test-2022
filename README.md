  App running at:
  - Local:   http://localhost:8080/
  - Network: http://192.168.1.246:8080/

now you can navigate to http://localhost:8080 in your browser to see the working app.

This is a news feed app.

Your assignment:
1. **Replace** the article in `./src/App.vue` with a component. See `./src/components/HelloWorld.vue` for an example of a component and `./src/App.vue` for an example on how to consume. You may choose to refactor the HTML in the component to use `div`s instead of a table to organize HTML elements.
2. In `./src/App.vue` loop through the array of articles in `./assets/data.json` to render components with values from the array.
3. Style the Article component with the following using CSS:
   1. Title should have a yellow background
   2. text should be italicized
   3. article image should have rounded corners
   4. The article image should alternate from left to right (view the example screen shot ./public/Screenshot-example.png)


There is no time limit for this assessment.

Use as many outside resources as you need.

This is not a test of technical ability, but a test of how quickly you can pick up new languages, workflows, and skills. Do your best. Before submitting, make sure it compiles and runs.
