This is a news feed app.

Your assignment is to build a reusable component to **replace** each article in `./src/App.vue`. You should not use the table format in the example article.

You will need to loop through the data array of articles to populate your component for each article. There is an example of a component in `./src/components/HelloWorld.vue`

Each Article title should have a yellow highlighted background and the text should be italicized. The article image should have rounded corners and every other article the image should be on the opposite side. This should be done with CSS.
